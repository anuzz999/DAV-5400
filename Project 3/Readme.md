Options Data Analysis Project
=============================

Description
-----------

This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of options trading data. It includes various modules for exploratory data analysis, visualization, inference analysis, and predictive modeling. The project is structured as a Python package for ease of use and reproducibility.

Installation
------------

To install the project package, navigate to the project's root directory (where `setup.py` is located) and run:

bashCopy code

`pip install .`

This command will install the package along with all required dependencies.

Usage
-----

The package is divided into several modules, each responsible for different aspects of the data analysis:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This module provides functionalities to explore and understand the dataset.

pythonCopy code

`from project_package.eda_module import EDA
eda = EDA(your_dataframe)
eda.some_functionality()`

### Inference Analysis

In this module, various inference analyses like correlation, multivariate analysis, and temporal trends are performed.

pythonCopy code

`from project_package.inference_module import Inference
inference = Inference(your_dataframe)
inference.correlation_analysis()
inference.multivariate_analysis()
# etc.`

### Predictive Modeling

Includes functionalities for building and evaluating predictive models.

pythonCopy code

`from project_package.modeling_module import Model
model = Model(your_dataframe)
model.train_model()
model.evaluate_model()`

### Visualization

This module contains functions for generating different plots and visualizations.

pythonCopy code

`from project_package.visualization_module import Visualization
viz = Visualization(your_dataframe)
viz.plot_type_one()
viz.plot_type_two()
# etc.`
