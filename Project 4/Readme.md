SPY Options Advanced Data Analysis Project
=========================================

Description
-----------

Project 4 advances the comprehensive analysis of SPY options trading data begun in Project 3. This iteration incorporates an extended suite of tools for time series analysis, predictive modeling with cross-validation, and model tuning. The project is structured as a ```python package to maintain ease of use and reproducibility.

Installation
------------

To install the Project 4 package, navigate to the project's root directory (where `setup.py` is located) and run:

```bash
pip install .
```
This command will install the package along with all required dependencies.

Usage
The package comprises several modules, each dedicated to different aspects of the data analysis process:

Time Series Analysis
This module handles the analysis of option price trends over time.

```python

from spy_analysis.time_series_analysis import TimeSeriesAnalysis
time_series = TimeSeriesAnalysis(your_dataframe)
time_series.perform_stationarity_test()
time_series.decompose_time_series()
# etc.
```
Predictive Modeling
Builds upon the initial model by implementing cross-validation and model tuning capabilities.

```python

from spy_analysis.model_preparation import ModelPreparation
model_prep = ModelPreparation(your_dataframe)
model_prep.perform_cross_validation()
model_prep.tune_model_hyperparameters()
# etc.
```
Strategy Simulation
Simulates trading strategies based on model predictions and evaluates their potential returns.

```python

from spy_analysis.strategy_simulation import StrategySimulation
strategy_sim = StrategySimulation(your_dataframe)
strategy_sim.simulate_trading_strategy()
# etc.
```
Visualization
Enhanced to include time series visualizations and model diagnostics.

```python

from spy_analysis.visualization import Visualization
viz = Visualization(your_dataframe)
viz.plot_time_series()
viz.plot_model_diagnostics()
# etc.
```
Features
Time Series Analysis: Conducts stationarity tests and decomposes option price trends.
Predictive Modeling: Employs cross-validation and pipeline structures for robust model evaluation.
Strategy Simulation: Tests the viability of trading strategies using predictive model outputs.
Visualization: Offers advanced plotting functions to visualize time series and model results.
