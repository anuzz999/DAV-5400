# Options Market EDA Project

## Overview

This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on options market data to uncover insights into various option attributes, including the Greeks, Implied Volatility (IV), and Days to Expiry (DTE).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Objectives

- To understand the behavior of IV, especially its relationship with the Greeks.
- To explore how different option attributes evolve as they approach their expiry date.
- To gain insights into the distribution of options based on their strike price distance from the underlying asset.

## Data Loading

Let's start by loading the data from the source.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your data here
# df = pd.read_csv('your_data_source.csv')

## Data Cleaning

Before diving into the analysis, let's ensure that the dataset is clean and free from anomalies and inconsistencies.

# Data Visualization

We'll use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization to generate histograms, scatter plots, and more.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Perform data visualization here
```

# Statistical Analysis

Let's investigate patterns, correlations, and trends within the dataset.

```python
# Perform statistical analysis here
```

# Graphical Analysis

Using Python's powerful tools, we can illustrate our findings and provide clear visual interpretations.

```python
# Perform graphical analysis here
```

# Key Findings

- Relationship between IV and the Greeks is complex, with specific attention to Vega.
- As options approach expiry, the attributes defined by the Greeks undergo shifts influenced by multiple factors.
- Insights into the landscape of ITM, ATM, and OTM options based on the relative positioning of strike prices were provided.
